# Linear Regression with One Variable - Feature Scaling

**Exercise:** Scale the first few elements of the Fibonacci sequence using 

- Min-max scaling,
- Mean normalization,
- using `sklearn.preprocessing.scale()`


```
fibonacci = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144]
```

Solution: `feature_scaling.py`
