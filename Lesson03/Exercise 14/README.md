# Support Vector Regression

Predict future stock prices based on a support vector regression model similar to the one we built in the Linear Regression exercise.

Based on the file `linear_regression_prediction.py`, replace the linear model with a support vector model.

Use the default Scikit-learn support vector regression model.

Then change your solution to use a degree 3 polynomial kernel.
