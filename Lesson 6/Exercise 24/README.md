# K-Means Clustering on Sales Data

We will be using the Sales Transactions Weekly Dataset from this URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sales_Transactions_Dataset_Weekly. 

Perform clustering on the dataset using the K-Means Algorithm. Make sure you prepare your data for clustering based on what you have learned in the previous lessons. Use the default settings for the K-Means algorithm.

Find the cluster centers and the labels belonging to the sales data.
