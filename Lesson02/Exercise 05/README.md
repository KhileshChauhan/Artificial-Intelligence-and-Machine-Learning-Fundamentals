# Exercise 05: Pathfinding with the A* Algorithm

Implement the A* algorithm to find the path with the lowest cost.

Game field:

```
size = (7, 9)
start = (5, 3)
end = (6, 9)
obstacles = {
    (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8),
    (4, 5),
    (5, 5), (5, 7), (5, 9),
    (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 7),
    (7, 7)
}


def successors(state, visited_nodes):
    (row, col) = state
    (max_row, max_col) = size
    succ_states = []
    if row > 1:
        succ_states += [(row-1, col)]
    if col > 1:
        succ_states += [(row, col-1)]
    if row < max_row:
        succ_states += [(row+1, col)]
    if col < max_col:
        succ_states += [(row, col+1)]
    return [s for s in succ_states if s not in visited_nodes if s not in obstacles]
```

## Execution

Run `astar( start, end )` to execute the A* algorithm.

For more information on how the algorithm executes, run `astar_verbose( start, end )`.

To get the shortest path, run `astar_with_path( start, end )`.
