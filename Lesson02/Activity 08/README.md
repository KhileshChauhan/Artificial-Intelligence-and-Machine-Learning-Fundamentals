# Activity 08: Connect 4 game with the EasyAI library

## Scenario 

Use the EasyAI library to implement an AI player playing the Connect Four game.  

The game is played by two players, just like Tic-Tac-Toe. The game board is seven cells wide and cells high. When you make a move, you can only select the column in which you drop your token. Then gravity pulls the token down to the lowest possible empty cell. Your objective is to connect four of your own tokens horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does the same, or you run out of empty spaces. 

The AI player does not have to play very well, but it is expected to realize basic winning and losing situations.
