# Written digit detection with neural networks

This section will discuss how to provide more security for the cryptocurrency traders via the detection of hand-written digits. We will be using assuming that you are a software developer at a new Cryptocurrency trader platform. The latest security measure you are implementing requires the recognition of hand-written digits. Use the MNIST library to train a neural network to recognize digits. You can read more about this dataset on https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/. 

â€‹Improve the accuracy of the model as much as possible. To ensure that it happens correctly, you will need to complete the previous topic.

At the end of the training, print the confusion matrix and the accuracy score.
