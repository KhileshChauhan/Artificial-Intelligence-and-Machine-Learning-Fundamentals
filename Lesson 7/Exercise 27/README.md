# Handling constants with TensorFlow

Modify the code of the previous example `constants.py` such that you replace `input2` with a placeholder, and `input3` with a variable.

In the TensorFlow session, initialize this placeholder to `3.0`, and perform the same operations as before.

Initialize the `input3` variable to `0.0`.

Solution: `placeholder.py`
