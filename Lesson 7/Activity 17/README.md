# Written digit detection with neural networks

We will be assuming that your boss is not satisfied with the results you presented in Activity 1 and asks you to consider adding two hidden layers to your original model and determine whether new layers improve the accuracy of the model. And to ensure that it happens correctly, you will need to have the knowledge of Deep Learning. 

The solution of the previous activity is in the file `digits.py`. 

Modify this solution by applying deep learning.
