# Increase the accuracy of credit scoring

## Scenario 

The accuracy of credit scoring is currently quite bad: 66.5%. Find a way to increase it by a few percentage points. 

## Aim 

â€‹To learn how the parametrization of the K-nearest-neighbor classifier affects the end result.

## Solution

Increase the `K` of the K-nearest-neighbors algorithm. Try multiple numbers (5, 10, 15, 25, 50).
