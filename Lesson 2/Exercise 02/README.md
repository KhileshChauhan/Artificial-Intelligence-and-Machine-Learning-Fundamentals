# Tree traversal with Breadth First Search and Depth First Search

This exercise will traverse the tree rooted at `root`, and described by the function `succ`. The function `succ( node )` returns the list of successors of `node`.

Paste the code in the Jupyter QtConsole, then execute the following calls:

```
bfs_tree( root )
dfs_tree( root )
```
