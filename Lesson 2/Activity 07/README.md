# Activity 07: Tic-Tac-Toe static evaluation with a heuristic function

## Scenario 

Implement a heuristic evaluation in the Tic-Tac-Toe game. Use this heuristic function to statically evaluate the board and make the best move on each step. Generate statistics on how the AI plays against an opponent that could make any moves. 

## Aim 

â€‹To implement simple heuristics.

## Execution 

Execute `countPossibilities()` to count all the possible game outcomes.
